        👋 Hey there! I'm <b>Ajay Sharma</b>, a <b>Full Stack Developer</b> based
          in New Delhi. 🏙️
        </p>
        <p>
          At 22, I'm wrapping up my{" "}
          <b>B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering</b><br/> but my passion for
          coding has been running strong for years. 💻
        </p>
        <p>
          I love working with React ⚛️ Node.js 🟢 and Spring Boot 🍃 to build robust
          web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Mobile development?</b> That's where <b>React Native</b> 📱 comes in
          handy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also pretty comfortable with libraries like <b>Socket.io</b> and&nbsp;  
          <b>Redux</b> to add that extra functionality when needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you might find me tinkering with <b>Linux</b> -
          it's a bit of a hobby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, and Docker 🐳? It's become an essential part of my project workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy the challenge of creating efficient, scalable solutions,
          whether it's for the web or mobile.<br/> Always eager to learn and grow in
          this ever-evolving tech world! 🚀
